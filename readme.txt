Description:
This project consists of reading a file and saving the value in a hashTable implemented from scratch in C programming.
The hashTable  test the different values for the specifications and make sure no duplicate before inserting them. While inserting a hash log is displayed to the user to see whether the different values were inserted or not.
At the end of the insertion, the content of the hashTable is displayed on to screen. The extra credit portion consists of reading a file for input and then searching the hashTable for different results based on the parameter and display to the screen.

Extra Credit:
Yes I completed the extra credits

Experience:
At the beginning of the project, it was easy since I took C programming almost 3 years ago so I have to go review a lot about pointer and strings manipulation.
At first, I had an issue reading the file correctly due to how I was using strtok. After I solve this the rest was not too bad but I after was running into some issues with pointers issues and types mismatch. But once I got over this issue I was ready to finish the project. 
It was not an easy experience completing the project but it was fun to complete it.

Shortcomings:
No shortcomings exist

Improvements:
For improvements, I will use a better hash function to limit the collision or implement a linklist to use as a chain and have a better insertion.
